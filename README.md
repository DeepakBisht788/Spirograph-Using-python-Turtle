# Colorful Rotating Circles with Turtle Graphics{Spirograph}

This program uses Python's **turtle** module to create a colorful pattern of rotating circles. The turtle draws multiple circles, each with a random color, and rotates slightly after each one to create an engaging, colorful pattern.

## Features
- Draws multiple circles with random colors.
- The turtle rotates after each circle to create a rotating pattern.
- Fully customizable circle size, rotation, and speed.

## How It Works
1. The turtle draws a circle of a fixed size.
2. The turtle then rotates slightly and draws another circle.
3. The colors of the circles change randomly with each draw.
4. The process repeats to form a pattern of colorful, rotating circles.
